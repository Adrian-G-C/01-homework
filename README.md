## Homework Challenge 1

## Description

For our first homework assignment we reviewed a marketing agencies website and made appropriate changes to allow for improved accesability standards. 

Changes were made to the HTML to provide semantic elements that would improve accesibility standards and better optimize the website for search engines. 

Along with changes to the HTML, we also made the necessary adjustments to the websites CSS to reflect the HTML element changes, while also reorganizing the CSS in sequencial order to mirror the HTML file.
